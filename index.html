          <li>Axel Munthe was born in Oskarshamn, Sweden, his family's home.[1] His family was originally of Flemish descent, and settled in Sweden during the 16th century.</li>
          <li>Munthe began college <span class="bold">in 1874</span> at Uppsala University.</li>
          <li>After graduation, Munthe opened a medical practice in Paris, largely catering to the members of the Scandinavian art colony there.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">In 1887</span>, he moved to Capri, bought the Villa San Michele and began restoration, doing much of the work himself, but also employing local residents, including three brothers and their father.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">In 1890</span>, running low on money for the project, he opened a practice in Rome which catered to foreign dignitaries as well as the local population. From this point onwards he divided his time between Rome and Capri.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">In 1892</span>, Munthe was appointed physician to the Swedish royal family.</li>
          <li>During the First World War, Munthe became a British citizen and served in the ambulance corps.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">In 1919â€“1920</span>, Munthe was an unwilling landlord to the outrageous socialite and muse Luisa Casati, who took possession of Villa San Michele.</li>
          <li>Munthe died at Stockholm Palace aged 91. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered into the North Sea. </li>
